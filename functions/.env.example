# ========================================
# Firebase Cloud Functions Environment Variables
# ========================================
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values.
# NEVER commit the .env file to version control!
#
# To set environment variables for Firebase Functions:
# 1. For local development: Copy to .env
# 2. For production: Use Firebase Functions config:
#    firebase functions:config:set security.internal_secret="your-secret"
# ========================================

# GCP Configuration
# These are typically set automatically by Firebase, but can be overridden
GCP_PROJECT_ID=mddprod-2954f
GCP_LOCATION=us-central1

# ========================================
# DEPRECATED: Internal Secret
# ========================================
# The INTERNAL_SECRET is no longer used in production.
# Cloud Tasks authentication is now handled via OIDC tokens.
# This is kept for backward compatibility with existing deployments.
# 
# If you must use a shared secret (not recommended), generate a 
# cryptographically secure random string:
#   openssl rand -base64 32
#
# INTERNAL_SECRET=your-secure-random-string-here

# ========================================
# Security Notes
# ========================================
# 1. All HTTP endpoints now require OIDC token authentication
# 2. onCall functions automatically verify Firebase Auth
# 3. Firestore Security Rules provide the primary authorization layer
# 4. Input validation is implemented in both client and server code
#
# For production deployment:
# - Enable Firebase App Check for additional protection
# - Review and test all Firestore Security Rules
# - Monitor Cloud Functions logs for security events
# - Set up alerts for unusual activity
